# Image recognition model

# Task: 
# Develop a model for image recognition

# Key considerations:
# - Data Augmentation: Enhance the dataset's diversity and robustness through augmentation techniques.
# - Model Architecture: Select or design a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
# - Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for image-related tasks.
# - SE Best Practices: Follow SE best practices for code quality, including modularization and version control.
